    "In basketball, coaches often call timeouts when the opposing team is on a scoring run, commonly referred to as \"stopping the bleeding.\" This analysis explores whether this coaching strategy is effective by examining NBA timeout data from five seasons (1999-00, 2004-05, 2010-11, 2016-17, 2022-23).\n",

    "**Research Question:** Do timeouts effectively disrupt opponent momentum during scoring runs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** When the opponent team makes a scoring run of 6-0 or better and a timeout is called, the opponent's offensive efficiency decreases after the timeout compared to before.\n",

    "**Methodology:** We analyzed play-by-play data from NBA games, identifying instances where:\n",
    "1. A team went on a scoring run of 6+ points to 0\n",
    "2. The opposing team called a timeout\n",
    "3. We compared the offensive efficiency of the scoring team before and after the timeout\n",
