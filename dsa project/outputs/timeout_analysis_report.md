# NBA Timeout Analysis Summary Report

## Overall Results

* Total timeouts analyzed: 2490
* Effective timeouts: 1433 (57.6%)
* Average change in opponent offensive efficiency: -3.669 points per possession

## Statistical Significance

* t-statistic: -11.608
* p-value: 2.237674e-30
* Result: The effect of timeouts on opponent offensive efficiency is statistically significant

## Hypothesis Test Results

**Null Hypothesis (Hâ‚€):** When the opponent team makes a scoring run and a timeout is called, the opponent's average offensive efficiency from the start of the period to the timeout equals its average offensive efficiency from the timeout to the end of the period.

**Result:** p-value < 0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis. Timeouts have been found to significantly reduce opponent offensive efficiency.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that timeouts are effective in disrupting opponent momentum. After an opponent's scoring run, timeouts lead to a statistically significant decrease in their offensive efficiency. This provides empirical evidence supporting the common basketball coaching practice of calling timeouts to "stop the bleeding" when the opponent is on a run.
