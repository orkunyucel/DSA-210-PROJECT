        "This analysis investigates whether timeouts called during an opponent's scoring run effectively disrupt their momentum by examining changes in offensive efficiency before and after a timeout is called. The project analyzes NBA play-by-play data across multiple seasons to quantify the effectiveness of timeouts in \"stopping the bleeding.\"\n",

        "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** Under the same scenario, the opponent's average offensive efficiency changes after a timeout is called."

        "These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the common coaching practice of calling timeouts to \"stop the bleeding\" when the opponent is on a scoring run. The evidence suggests this strategy is generally effective, though its effectiveness varies based on context."
